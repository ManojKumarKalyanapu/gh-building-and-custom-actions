Building and Using Custom Actions in GitHub Actions:
What Are Custom Actions?
Custom actions are reusable components in GitHub Actions workflows. They help encapsulate functionality and logic that can be reused across multiple workflows or repositories.

There are 3 types of custom actions:
1.JavaScript actions – Built using Node.js, fast and widely used.
2.Docker container actions – Run inside a container; good for language/runtime-specific tasks.
3.Composite actions – Combine multiple shell commands or other actions.
